**Today's Progress**: Learned an algorithm on how to Invert a Binary Tree.

**Thoughts:** I really enjoyed formulating the algorithm on how to invert a Binary Tree. I did struggled on a slightly different problem to my binary tree (the insertion method of my BinaryTree class) where I'm having an infinite loop. I just found out that I haven't accounted for inserting an item that's already existing on the tree so I just decided to ignore these instances by returning None value and finally fixed the bug on the insert method of my BinaryTree class. But overall, my algorithm for inverting a binary tree works and I really enjoyed how I thought of formulating a solution to make a recursive function.
